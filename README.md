# This Repository contains materials on Organizational Incident Response Plan

The module provides guidelines for incident handling, particularly for analyzing incident-related data and determining the appropriate response to each incident. The guidelines can be followed independently of particular hardware platforms, operating systems, protocols, or applications.

A module, in turn, consists of presentation with an introduction to the topic and additional materials, which are linked in terms of content and are rounded off thematically, availiable in English and Ukrainian versions.
