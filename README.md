# CTO Mentorship Program: Module 1

The USAID Cybersecurity for Critical Infrastructure in Ukraine Activity created five repositories with materials developed for CTO mentorship program in 2021. 

To best safeguard the critical infrustructure (CI) objects’ digital assets and reputation, CTOs, cybersecurity management teams, IT managers, security and systems managers need to develop a robust, yet flexible incident response plan tailored to the company’s unique needs. A comprehensive plan allows to respond to incidents quickly and effectively and is crucial for minimizing damage and recovering from an incident. The first module of this program provides guidelines on creating analyzing incident-related data, determining an appropriate response to each incident, and developing incident reposnse plan. The guidelines can be followed independently of particular hardware platforms, operating systems, protocols, or applications. 

These materials were prepared by Catalisto LLC for the USAID Cybersecurity for Critical Infrastructure in Ukraine Activity.
