# Module 1. Development of an Organizational Incident Response Plan for responding to threats

The module provides guidelines for incident handling, particularly for analyzing incident-related data and determining the appropriate response to each incident. The guidelines can be followed independently of particular hardware platforms, operating systems, protocols, or applications.

A module, in turn, consists of presentation with an introduction to the topic and additional materials and availiable in English and Ukrainian versions, which are linked in terms of content and are rounded off thematically.
