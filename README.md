# CTO Mentorship Program: Module 1

To best safeguard the organization’s digital assets and reputation, CTOs, cybersecurity management teams, IT managers, security and systems managers among different sectors need to develop a robust, yet flexible incident response plan tailored to the company’s unique needs. A comprehensive plan allows them to respond to incidents quickly and effectively and is crucial for minimizing damage and recovering from an incident.

This repositories’ materials and presentation, developed as a part of CTO mentorship program, covers areas where incident response is part of the incident management process. It also covers techniques and mechanisms used to identify and deal with cybersecurity incidents and develop organizational incident response plan.

The first module provides guidelines for incident handling, particularly for analyzing incident-related data and determining the appropriate response to each incident. The guidelines can be followed independently of particular hardware platforms, operating systems, protocols, or applications.
