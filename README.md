# CTO Mentorship Program: Module 1

The USAID Cybersecurity for Critical Infrastructure in Ukraine Activity created five repositories with materials developed for CTO mentorship program in 2021. 

The first module of this program provides guidelines on developing organiztional incident response plan. 

No organization, regardless of size, is exempt from cybersecurity threats, and having an established plan of action that immediately executes following a security breach is crucial to limit incident costs and damages to the company's reputation. Some companies, particularly those that haven't yet experienced a major security incident, don't know where to begin, let alone what to prioritize. An incident is a matter of when, not if, a compromise or violation of an organizationâ€™s security will happen. The preparation of the Computer Incident Response Team (CIRT) through planning, communication, and practice of the incident response process will provide the necessary experience needed should an incident occur within your organization. 

Each phase from preparation to lessons learned is extremely beneficial to follow in sequence, as each one builds upon the other. The following phases will provide a basic foundation to be able to perform incident response and allow one to create their own incident response plan. 

These materials were prepared by Catalisto LLC for the USAID Cybersecurity for Critical Infrastructure in Ukraine Activity.
